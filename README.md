# Python
Dummy scripts
I created a script where it downloads the daily closing price of a specific stock as well as the exchange rate EUR/YEN. 
In addition i added the number of Stock Options granted in order to calculate the total portfolio value (not-excercised) 
Last, the portfolio price is sent via email.( see Issues.)
